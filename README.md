## Reading
- [steins;gem on fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12482258/1/steinsgem) (which is oddly unwelcoming of the titular semicolon)
- This repository contains advance drafts. They will contain spelling and formatting errors are subject to retconjuration.
- The [pdf version](https://github.com/madokamadokamadoka/sg/raw/master/steinsgem.pdf) is nicer.
- The `org` directory above has the text by chapter, which you can browse right here on Github
  - you can view the version history to spot changes and see what secret history has been buried :)
  - you can even add comments on github, [if that is what you desire](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/nanoha/images/f/f7/Raising_Heart.png/revision/latest?cb=20161126045343)
- The `html` directory is pretty plain and devoid of formatting for the time being.
